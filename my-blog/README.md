## What I Learned

The first lesson was learned even before the coding started. File managment and how keeping it tidy is **key** to having a smooth and coherent project. Assignment 1 helped me to learn more about the way that data flows between components. For example we make changes to the style sheet in blog post that has an effect on our post.js. For Assignment 2 we focused on implementing a like button and comment section using useState to allow for the changing of either of these over time in our app.
